Anytime you make changes and you like them, just ask the AI to do the following:

"Push and commit all changes to github."

The AI wont be able to add your photos to the images folder itself, but if you look inside the images folder there will be a README.txt that explains what to do.
Essentially, just drag the photo you want to use from your files to the images folder, and rename it to the corresponding thing. 
The AI can also help with naming. 

Once you do the "Push and commit all changes to github." using the AI, it should automatically update the website so you don't need to do anything else just wait a few mins for it to update.


If you want to just check what it looks like without adding to github, run: npm run dev in terminal (ask ai to do this)

add PonyCards_Page_02 after 01(you have that) then PonyCards_Page_03 PonyCards_Page_04.
